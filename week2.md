Before code school I was using my computer for daily tasks and watching YouTube videos often.  Now that I am 2 weeks done with code boot-camp, I am still doing those things, but also creating digital content (and a lot of my YouTube recommended is now coding related).  I was nervous about the load of code school and week 1 proved to be lighter than I expected and I even was getting a little bored.  On that first weekend, I went ahead and did another mini project to challenge myself more.  Then week 2 hit... the load at home was a lot more, but it has been really good for my brain to grow.  I have learned so much already in these 2 weeks after drinking from a fire hose, but I am really optimistic and excited to learn more.  After the next 2 weeks it will be interesting to see what all I know and will be able to do compared to now!
